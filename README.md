# myvueapp


the project is created to demonstrate the applicaton of a type of data structures, recursions, in programming. the recursion logic in this is case is effected in the function schedulePassenger. 
This is offers a dynamic appproach to passenger assignment compared to traditional loops. the logic is expected to sweep through the list of trips, evaluate each trip against passengers travel preferences and ofcourse proceed to the next trip if the current one is full or doesnt meet the time requirements.
 I have the following functions in the project:
   passenger- which schedules the individuals.
   triplists- this is the array that contains available trips.

if the current trip departur time is equal to or later than the passengers preffered time and seats are available, the passenger is scheduled. if the trip doesn't meet the conditions, the functions calls itself with index+1, evaluating the next in line.
